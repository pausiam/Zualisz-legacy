    <h2>About Zualisz</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Zualisz</strong> is more than a Waveful user — she’s a fighter, a light, and a voice of hope.  
      Through challenges that would silence many, she continues to share kindness, creativity, and warmth in every corner of the Waveful community.  
      This space honors her strength and supports her path to becoming an Ambassador — a title she already lives through her resilience and grace.
